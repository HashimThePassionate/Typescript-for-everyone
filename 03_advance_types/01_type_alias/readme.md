# 📅 **Type Alias in TypeScript**

In this section, we will improve upon our `Employee` object implementation from the previous section by introducing **Type Aliases**. This approach helps us follow the **DRY principle** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and write cleaner, reusable code.

---

## 👷 **The Employee Object (Previous Implementation)**

Previously, we defined an `Employee` object like this:

```typescript
const employee: {
  readonly id: number; // 🆔 Read-only property
  name: string;        // 👤 Employee name
  retire: (date: Date) => void; // 📅 Method to handle retirement
} = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Muhammad Hashim",
  retire: (date: Date) => {
    console.log(date);
  },
};
```

While this works, it introduces some challenges:

1. **⚠️ Duplication of Code**:  
   - If you want to create another `Employee` object, you’ll need to **repeat the structure** for all properties and methods.  
   - This violates the **DRY principle** (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

2. **🚧 Lack of Reusability**:  
   - The object structure cannot be reused across your codebase, making maintenance harder.  

3. **🛠 Inefficient Updates**:  
   - If you need to modify the object shape (e.g., add or remove a property), you’ll have to manually update all instances, increasing the risk of errors.

## 🌟 **Introducing Type Alias**

A **Type Alias** is a convenient way to define a reusable type in TypeScript. It allows you to group properties and methods into a single, reusable type definition.  

Here’s how we can redefine the `Employee` object using a **Type Alias**:

1. Use **PascalCase** for naming the type (`Employee` with a capital `E`).  
2. Define the properties and methods inside curly braces `{}`.  
3. Reuse the type wherever you need to create an object with the same structure.

## 🔄 **Benefits of Type Aliases**

- **📋 Reusability**:  
  - Define the structure once and reuse it across your codebase, reducing duplication.  

- **🛡 Maintainability**:  
  - Easily update the type in one place to reflect changes across all related objects.  

- **✅ Cleaner Code**:  
  - Improve readability and organization by separating type definitions from implementation.

## 🔧 **How to Refactor with Type Alias**

Instead of repeating the object structure in multiple places, we can define a **Type Alias** for `Employee` like this:

```typescript
type Employee = {
  readonly id: number;       // 🆔 Unique, immutable identifier
  name: string;              // 👤 Employee's name
  retire: (date: Date) => void; // 📅 Retirement method
};
```

Now, the `Employee` object can be created like this:

```typescript
const employee: Employee = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Muhammad Hashim",
  retire: (date: Date) => {
    console.log(date);
  },
};
```

With this setup, you can define multiple `Employee` objects **without repeating** the structure.

## ✨ **Key Takeaways**

1. **Type Alias** allows you to define reusable type structures.  
2. Reduces code duplication and promotes adherence to the **DRY principle**.  
3. Enhances code readability and maintainability.  
4. Makes it easy to apply consistent types across your application.

## 🛠 **Next Steps**

- Refactor your existing objects to use **Type Aliases**.  
- Practice defining reusable types for various structures in your application.  
- Explore combining **Type Aliases** with **Interfaces** for advanced scenarios.
